# JSON to PostgreSQL Data Loader

This Python script is designed to help you seamlessly transfer structured JSON data into a PostgreSQL database. It is a valuable tool for managing and organizing your data for further analysis and querying.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the script effectively:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Cleaned JSON Data

Make sure you have a cleaned and structured JSON file ready for import. Ensure that it matches the structure of the target database table.

### Step 2: Configure Database Connection

Open the script and replace placeholders ('your_database_name', 'your_username', 'your_password', 'your_host') with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials.

### Step 3: Define Database Table Structure

Customize the "create_table_query" to match your specific database table structure. Add columns as needed to represent the fields in your JSON data.

### Step 4: Run the Script

Execute the script, and it will:

- Connect to your PostgreSQL database.
- Create the target table if it doesn't already exist.
- Insert data from your cleaned JSON file into the database.

### Step 5: Check the Database

After running the script, check your PostgreSQL database to ensure that the data has been successfully loaded into the specified table.

## Notes

- It's important to ensure that your cleaned JSON data matches the database schema defined in the script.
- Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed, such as psycopg2.
- Always back up your database before performing data imports to prevent data loss.

This script simplifies the process of transferring data from JSON files to your PostgreSQL database, making your data management tasks more efficient and organized.

## Example Code

```python
import json
import psycopg2

# Step 1: Read messy JSON data
with open('messy_data.json', 'r') as file:
    messy_data = json.load(file)

# Step 2: Data cleaning and structuring
# Implement data cleaning logic here (e.g., handling missing values, duplicates, data type conversion, etc.)

# Step 3: Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname='your_database_name',
    user='your_username',
    password='your_password',
    host='your_host'
)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Step 4: Create database tables (assuming you haven't already)
create_table_query = '''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS gaming_data (
    event_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id INT,
    event_type VARCHAR(255),
    event_date DATE,
    ...
);
'''
cursor.execute(create_table_query)
conn.commit()

# Step 5: Load data into the database
for record in cleaned_data:
    insert_query = '''
    INSERT INTO gaming_data (player_id, event_type, event_date, ...)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, ...);
    '''
    cursor.execute(insert_query, (record['player_id'], record['event_type'], record['event_date'], ...))

conn.commit()

# Step 6: Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

This example code covers the basic steps of reading JSON data, cleaning it, connecting to a PostgreSQL database, creating a table, and inserting data into the database. You will need to adapt this code to your specific use case, including handling all the data cleaning challenges and the actual database structure.

Remember that you should explore the data thoroughly, identify issues, and develop appropriate data cleaning strategies as mentioned in your assignment instructions. The code provided is just a starting point to help you understand the process.
