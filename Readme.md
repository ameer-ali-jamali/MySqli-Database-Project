Welcome to the epic world of Ethera in "Mystic Quest," where you'll embark on an unforgettable adventure through the Lost Kingdoms. Dive into a rich narrative filled with intrigue, magic, and a fight for freedom. As the prophesied hero, you'll challenge the oppressive rule of 'The Shadow,' reclaim the shattered Orb of Unity, and restore the balance to Ethera.

## Game Lore

In a bygone age, Ethera was a utopia where arcane energies and earthly delights coexisted, sustained by the Orb of Unity. The Orb governed four realms: Valoria, Cimmeria, Elphora, and Orynthia, ensuring a harmonious interplay of power, knowledge, and magic. However, 'The Shadow' emerged, fragmenting the Orb and imposing a new regime of control. The kingdoms now suffer under a dystopian regime. It's your destiny to liberate Ethera from The Shadow's grasp.
