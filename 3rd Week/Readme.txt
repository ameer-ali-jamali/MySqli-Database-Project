I see you want to perform get (SELECT), update, and delete operations with joins in a single document. Here's an example of how you can do that using SQL:

Assuming you have the following tables: `Players`, `Guilds`, and `GuildMembers`, and you want to retrieve, update, and delete records while joining these tables.

1. **Get (SELECT) with Joins:**

   Let's say you want to retrieve the player names and their respective guild names:

   ```sql
   SELECT Players.player_name, Guilds.guild_name
   FROM Players
   JOIN GuildMembers ON Players.player_id = GuildMembers.player_id
   JOIN Guilds ON GuildMembers.guild_id = Guilds.guild_id;
   ```

2. **Update with Joins:**

   Suppose you want to update the player level of all players who are in a specific guild:

   ```sql
   UPDATE Players
   JOIN GuildMembers ON Players.player_id = GuildMembers.player_id
   JOIN Guilds ON GuildMembers.guild_id = Guilds.guild_id
   SET Players.player_level = 10
   WHERE Guilds.guild_name = 'MyGuild';
   ```

3. **Delete with Joins:**

   Let's assume you want to delete all players who are not members of any guild:

   ```sql
   DELETE Players
   FROM Players
   LEFT JOIN GuildMembers ON Players.player_id = GuildMembers.player_id
   WHERE GuildMembers.player_id IS NULL;
   ```

These queries demonstrate how you can perform SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations with joins in a single document. Make sure to adjust the table and column names to match your specific database schema.
